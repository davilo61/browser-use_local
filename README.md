# Python Browser-Use AI Agent

This repository is a Python implementation of the Browser-Use AI Agent sample project. It demonstrates how to integrate AI with browser automation to perform various tasks, providing a foundation for building more complex automated workflows.

## Features

- **Browser Automation:** Interact with a web browser using Python.
- **AI Integration:** Utilize AI to make decisions and perform actions in the browser.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extend or modify the agent for your specific needs.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Basic understanding of Python and Git
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
This will launch the AI agent which will then interact with your web browser to perform the pre-defined tasks. Customize the behavior by modifying the configuration or extending the code as needed.

Configuration
If your project requires specific settings (e.g., API keys, browser options), update the configuration file (e.g., .env or a dedicated config file) with your values. Make sure to add these configuration files to your .gitignore to avoid accidentally committing sensitive data.
